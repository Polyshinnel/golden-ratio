            <h1>ABOUT LE COQ PORCELAINE</h1>
            <p>LE COQ PORCELAINE’ s project comes to reality in 2019, when the brand is acquired by ILSA s.r.l. From here the company embarks on a new itinerary of designing and developing high performance products intended for the Ho.Re.Ca. and banqueting world. The brand was created during the 80 ’ s in Florence, the beating heart of the Italian culture, cradle of the Renaissance and one of the most exquisite art cities in the world.</p>

            <p>The acquisition of the brand comes as more than a business takeover: it sets off the union of two realities. On one side the Tuscan artistic genius - embodied in the resourcefulness and vitality of the brand LE COQ PORCELAINE - on the other, the Piedmontese reliability and entrepreneurial attitude - represented by Ilsa.</p>
