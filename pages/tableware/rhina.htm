            <h1>ITALIAN HANDMADE CERAMICS SINCE 1995</h1>
            <p>Through action, doing, representing, our deepest truth is manifested. Matter becomes an instrument of revelation of consciousness in the story of the "journey of life". Forms in balance between mind and soul. The mind demands defined borders and lines, the soul expresses itself in softness and movement. The experience is in the oscillation of opposites. Balance is the real goal, quiet the purpose.</p>

            <h2>RINA AND HER LOVE FOR THE MATTER</h2>
            <p>Rinaâ€™s intent is that the object should not impose itself but, rather, suggest sensations, both visual and tactile able to evoke our deepest emotions.</p>

            <p>Rina works the clay without ever feeling a ceramist: "Clay allows me to give a threedimensional shape to the here-and-now me. It is a way of communicating with myself, and therefore with others. I simply strive to respect the natural surfacing of things that are already within us".</p>
