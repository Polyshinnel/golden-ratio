            <p>The brand is named after the Kenai Peninsula, located on the south coast of Alaska. This is an astounding place of grandeur and natural beauty. Here you will find wooded slopes, mighty glaciers, picturesque valleys, peat bogs, lowlands and breathtaking lakes and deep fjords. This picturesque natural world inspired us to create our first collection.</p>
