            <h1>FOUNDER</h1>
            <p>The founder of the TRUD workshop, Eldar Zeytullayev, graduated from the Faculty of Graphic Arts (Department of Graphic Design) and from 2009 has been engaged in photography. His photographic work can be found in the public collections of the Museum of Photographic Art in San Diego, USA and the Museum of Photography in Belgium.</p>
            <p>Eldar was especially fascinated by photographing plant forms, and this was the beginning of his great love for wood and its amazing textures.</p>

            <p>In 2013, Eldar founded a workshop in a small village by the sea surrounded by forest and mountains and the TRUD brand of handmade craft products was launched.</p>
            <p>The workshop began as a hobby, where only individual objects and interior design objects were created, intended to be passed down from generation to generation to eventually become a family heirloom or collectible. The value of such items increases over time, and versatile design is timeless.</p>

            <h2>NOWADAYS</h2>
            <p>Perhaps more than ever, people feel a deep connection with wooden objects and rethink their natural beauty. In the 21st century, we are witnessing a renaissance â€” as evidenced by the rapidly growing interest in natural practical wooden items of design, including in the hospitality industry.</p>

        <div class="info-block__text">
            <p>From a global perspective, wood is the most environmentally friendly and sustainable material with a record low carbon footprint, and this has a direct positive impact on the environment. In addition, the expected service lifetime of a solid wooden product is several decades, and with repair it can be extended many times over. In 2021, thanks to its first order from the Ritz Carlton, the workshop developed a collection of limited edition products for the hospitality industry (HoReCa).</p>

            <p>At TRUD, every detail is made by hand, from the initial selection of the wood and the careful sanding and surface finishing, to impregnation, drying and the final details. The art of working with wood requires the ability to work not only with the hands, but also with the mind and heart. We bestow the tree with a second life, embodying the beauty of nature in new forms, and we believe that thanks to our tableware and art objects for the interior, we will bring happiness and special meaning to everyday life.</p>
