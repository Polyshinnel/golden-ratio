            <h1>"ONE FOR ALL" – THE PREFERRED UNIVERSAL WINE GLASS</h1>
            <p>Often choosing the right glass is more difficult than choosing the right wine. What is more important to the wine connoisseur? A cupboard full of glasses or a cellar full of wine? Through intense collaboration with professional glass designers and the renowned wine critic René Gabriel the unique Gabriel-Glas was born; medium-sized, elegant and affordable. Where expert glass creation meets the knowledgeable connoisseur.</p>

            <p>The maximum width of 95 millimeters enables an instant decanting effect by providing a lot of air to the freshly poured wine. The nose passages are extended in the upper half of the goblet, which is tastefully bent conically inward. The precise 66-millimeter glass aperture optimally concentrates the bouquet and scents.</p>

            <p>The lowest half of the goblet, a V-shape curled outward, provides a kind of "push-up," absorbing a lot of fragrance even with a tiny amount of wine. Maximum color density is favored by the V-triangle at the very bottom of the glass goblet. When consumed, the wine glides rather broadly across the tongue. The glass stem (invisible X shape) enables exquisite grasping with all five fingers.</p>
