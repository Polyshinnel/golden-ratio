            <h1>SOLID WATER IS A BRAND OF TABLEWARE AND INTERIOR SOLUTIONS</h1>
            <p>Like water, we create atmosphere. Only not the atmosphere that surrounds the earth, but the one that surrounds the table on which food is served, and the space that surrounds it filled with people.</p>

            <p>We came in to being in 2014, when two of us — professional glass designers Anatoly Nikolaev and Anastasia Mikhailenko — jointly opened a small workshop. We started by processing glass, and released our first collection, Recycle, especially for restaurants. It consisted of serving platters, glasses and sets for spices made from recycled wine bottles.</p>

            <p>built on the principles of zero waste, where more than 150 types of products are produced for serving and for the interior. We are known in France, Germany, Estonia and other countries. We recently added accessories for chefs to our "glass" collection, as well as our first collection of wooden items.</p>

            <p>We draw our inspiration from the concise severity of the elements of St. Petersburg, where we were born, live and create our collections. We are fans of what nature teaches us, simplicity, constant renewal, freedom, and the connectivity of everything. Thank you to everyone who uses our products, and for sharing these values. Together we create each other and the atmosphere that we breathe.</p>
